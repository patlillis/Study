C# Implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms


## Data Structures
- **[Splay Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree)** - a self-adjusting binary search tree with the additional property that recently accessed elements are quick to access again.
- **[Suffix Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree)** - a compressed trie containing all the suffixes of the given text as their keys and positions in the text as their values.


## Algorithms
- **[0/1 Knapsack Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#0.2F1_knapsack_problem)** - Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
